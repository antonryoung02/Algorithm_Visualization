# Algorithm_Visualization

This project contains several datatype/algorithm classes such as Array, LinkedList, Recursion, and (hopefully) soon to be more. Including these functions alongside python algorithms creates an algorithm visualization using the manim library. The goal was to provide a more intuitive explanations for algorithms like those on leetcode.
