# Algorithm_Visualization

This project contains several datatype/algorithm classes such as Array, LinkedList, Recursion, Trees, Graphs, and soon to be more. Including these functions alongside python algorithms creates a visualization using the manim library. The goal was to provide a more intuitive and engaging explanations for algorithms like those on leetcode.
