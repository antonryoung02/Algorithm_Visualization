# Algorithm_Visualization

This project contains several datatype/algorithm classes such as Array, LinkedList, Recursion, and (hopefully) soon to be more. By implementing these functions alongside python algorithms, it creates a algorithm visualization using the manim library. The goal was to provide a more intuitive explanations for algorithms like those on leetcode.
